```
- **Image Preprocessing:** The image is resized and normalized to a standard size.
- **Feature Extraction:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract features from the image.
- **Caption Generation:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to generate a caption for the image, based on the extracted features.
